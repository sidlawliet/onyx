description: Verify this app in the browser with Reticle — drive one real flow and report what happened.
---

Verify this running app with Reticle. Drive it; do not read the code and guess.

## Pick ONE flow

Not the whole app. Pick the single most important flow you can complete in a handful of steps — the
one a user would do first (sign in, search, add to cart, submit the form). If the user named a flow or
just changed some code, use that one instead.

State which flow you picked in one line before you start.

## Drive it where the human can see

1. `reticle_sessions` — find the connected tab. None? Tell the user to run their dev server and open
   the app, then stop. Reticle never starts a dev server.
2. `reticle_snapshot` — read the accessibility tree and locate the elements the flow needs. Elements
   are addressable by role and name; you do **not** need `data-testid` to drive them.
3. Walk the flow with `reticle_act_and_wait`, one step at a time. Narrate each step first — the human
   is watching the page, and the HUD shows what you say.
4. After each step, check the effect with `reticle_assert` — not just that the click dispatched, but
   that the thing it was supposed to do actually happened.
5. Finish with `reticle_console` and `reticle_network` to catch errors the DOM does not show.

## Report

- What you drove, step by step, and what each step actually produced.
- Anything broken, with the `file:line` Reticle gave you.
- If a step could not be verified, say so plainly. "Unknown" is a real answer; a green verdict you
  cannot back is not.

Do not weaken or skip an assertion to make the run pass — that is a finding, not a fix.
